### Hi, I'm Yuliya Klimushina. I'm a data scientist and software developer

Software development is my passion. I like to learn, discover and try new things. I grow and develop myself every single day. I just don't know how else it could be! :)  

- I’m currently working on clustering analysis
- I’m currently learning machine learning methods and algorithms and plotly Dash (this is a really awesome visualization framework)
- How to reach me: yulits@gmail.com
